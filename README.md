# Personal Dotfiles

I created this repo to maintain the essential configuration files of a lot of the tools I frequently use
(neovim, git, zsh, and many others). Like any dotfiles repository, the idea is that my configuration should be easily 
replicable across other system and to avoid doing any manual rework whenever setting up a new computer. The configurtion is 
also meant to work **for me**, so if you wish to try out, read through the different files in the repo, use what you like, discard what you don't and build from there.
